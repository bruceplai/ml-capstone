We own a double-duplex brownstone in Clinton Hill on Gates near Classon Avenue -  (7 blocks to C train, 5 blocks to G train, minutes to all), in which we host on the entire top floor of the upper duplex.  This is more of an efficiency set-up: it is the top floor on a two-family, double duplex brownstone.  The top floor for our guests consists of a sizable bedroom, full bath and eat-in kitchen for your exclusive use.  Our family occupies the floors below.  You go through a common hallway and staircase, to get to the top floor (2 easy flights up from the main entrance), but not through any rooms, so it is a fairly private set-up. - Clinton Hill, Gates Avenue near Classon Ave. (1 mi. or less to Williamsburg, Park Slope, Pro</td>\n",
